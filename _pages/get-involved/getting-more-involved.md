    title: Getting More Involved
---

How can I get more involved in GREEN?

Great question! There are a ton of ways to contribute to the GREEN community, and we welcome everyone and anyone who wants to explore the intersection of technology, agriculture, and sustainability.

### Become a Leader!

We are always looking for passionate members to help lead workshops, projects, and events. We welcome contributors from all backgrounds and skill levels. If you are excited about getting others involved in AgTech and sustainability, come talk to us! Once you are involved, you can help lead initiatives anytime.

### Organize an Event!

- Did you love our last workshop and want to help organize another?
- Do you want to get a crew together for a field trip or hands-on project?
- Do you have a green tech event idea you want to see happen?

You are in the right place! We are always looking for members to facilitate events or create new ones. GREEN events can be anything from campus sustainability initiatives to AgTech demos to networking mixers. Dream up your idea, let us know at [greenucd@gmail.com](mailto:greenucd@gmail.com), and we can help you make it happen.

### Join the Board!

Do you want to give back to the GREEN community beyond attending events? Come join the members who keep GREEN running! The Board of Directors is a group of students and volunteers who all care deeply about advancing agricultural technology and sustainability at UC Davis.

We welcome new board members at any time. Keep an eye on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5krgBsWp3r) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/green.ucd/) for announcements. If you have a specific idea you want to spearhead, email [greenucd@gmail.com](mailto:greenucd@gmail.com).

You can check out the current board on the [Club Officers](/about/officers) page.
