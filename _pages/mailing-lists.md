    title: Initiative Directory
---

A convenient directory of campus agricultural technology resources — email lists to subscribe to, organizations to follow, and initiatives worth knowing about.

## Mailing Lists

Email lists are the best way to stay connected with events and conversations happening in AgTech around campus. On these lists, you can find conference buddies, ask questions about AgTech, and learn about upcoming department events!

UC Davis uses **Sympa** to manage campus email lists. To subscribe, send an email to [sympa@ucdavis.edu](mailto:sympa@ucdavis.edu) with the following in the message body:

```
subscribe listname Your First Name Your Last Name
```

Replace `listname` with the name of the list (e.g. `veninfo`). Leave the subject line blank and do not include a signature.

**Example:**

```
To: sympa@ucdavis.edu
Subject:
Body: subscribe veninfo Joe Wineo
```
