    title: Initiative Directory
---

A convenient directory of campus agricultural technology resources — email lists to subscribe to, organizations to follow, and initiatives worth knowing about.

## Mailing Lists

Email lists are a great way to stay connected with AgTech events and conversations happening around campus. On these lists, you can learn about upcoming department events, ask questions about AgTech, and find conference buddies!
